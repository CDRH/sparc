<div class="container home_alternate_band">
  <p>Salmon was a large pueblo and cultural center built around 1090 CE on the north bank of the San Juan River, 45 miles north of Chaco Canyon in the modern day city of Bloomfield, New Mexico.  Many Tribes and Nations claim ancestry to this place.  It is known by other names in the numerous Indigenous languages of the Southwest though it is commonly referred to by the surname of colonial settler George Salmon who owned the site from the early 1890s until 1956.  Today, the site is owned by San Juan County and preserved through the efforts of the San Juan County Museum Association, a non-profit organization. The <a href="" target="_blank">Salmon Ruins Museum <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"/></a> is open to the public.</p>

  <p>In the Prehispanic era, Salmon Pueblo was the first major colony established by the Chacoan people and is one of the largest Chacoan communities found outside of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chcu/index.htm" target="_blank">Chaco Culture National Historical Park <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"/></a>. It is one of only a few outlying Chacoan great houses excavated in the modern era.  At its zenith, the pueblo had over 275 rooms spread across three stories in an E-shaped configuration. This pueblo was occupied until about 1280 CE when much of the site was burned and inhabitants migrated to other areas of the Southwest. </p>
