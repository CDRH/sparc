<h3>Query</h3>

<p>Investigate and download Salmon Pueblo data, searching by context and/or artifact type.</p>

<p>This query page allows you to search within and across various data tables contained within SPARC (27 tables in all).  Some of these tables are inventories of what was found during the excavation of Salmon Pueblo, others are analysis tables created by research specialists. For more information about each table and their authors, please see the <%# TODO %><u>User Guide</u> and <u>Credits</u> page.</p>

<p>Using this query page, you can locate records of interest by clicking through a series of options starting with the navigation tabs above. You might start by selecting the “Features” tab and then filtering results based on criteria within the “Common Search Options” in the left-hand panel.  These search options include Unit Type, Unit Number, Occupation, Strata, and Feature.  Selecting the “Floor” option within “Strata” would  allow you, for instance, to search for all features associated with floors.</p>

<p>Users can also, for example, search for ceramic records based on excavation context (e.g., ceramics found exclusively within rooms or kivas). To do this, you would select the “Artifacts” tab, then select the “Ceramics” tab on the Artifacts Search page.  Once you are on the Ceramics page,  you must then select between the various (4) different ceramic data tables and filter your results using the Common Search Options panel on the left.</p>
