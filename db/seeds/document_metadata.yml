  brief_description: Salmon Pueblo was excavated between 1970 and 1978 under the direction of Cynthia Irwin-Williams, PhD, of Eastern New Mexico University, in partnership with the San Juan County Museum Association.  The San Juan Valley Archaeological Program (a.k.a the Salmon Project) resulted in the excavation of approximately one-third of Salmon Pueblo by professional archaeologists, field school crews, and local volunteers and generated more than 1.5 million artifacts and samples.
